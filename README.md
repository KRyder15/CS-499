Keagan Ryder – CS 499 ePortfolio

Welcome to my Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This site showcases the projects, skills, and growth I’ve developed throughout my degree program. Each artifact represents a core area of computer science: software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

About Me
I am a Computer Science student from Michigan with a passion for UI/UX design, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity. My goal is to create innovative, secure, and user-friendly software that improves technology’s role in everyday life.

Featured Projects

Category One – Software Engineering and Design
CS 360: Android Inventory Management App (Java)
A mobile application built in Android Studio that allows users to log in, manage inventory, and send SMS notifications when stock levels are low. It uses SQLite for local storage, modular architecture for maintainability, and demonstrates strong software design principles and UI development.

Category Two – Algorithms and Data Structures
CS 300: Auction Bids Program (C++)
A program that loads, stores, and manages auction bids using custom data structures. The enhancement improves efficiency by replacing a singly linked list with an AVL tree and a min heap, reducing search and insertion times from O(n) to O(log n).

Category Three – Databases
CS 340: Client/Server CRUD Application (Python and MongoDB)
A client/server application featuring a Python CRUD module connected to a MongoDB database. It includes a Dash web dashboard for visualization and analysis. The enhanced version adds schema validation, API authentication, caching, and aggregation analytics.

Skills Demonstrated
Software design and modular development
Data structure and algorithm optimization
Database modeling and API integration
Secure coding and data validation
Problem solving and system analysis
Communication and documentation of technical solutions
